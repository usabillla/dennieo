    <div class="container">
        <div id="terms-text">
            <h3>1. Information we Collect</h3>
            <p>When you register for Chatbox or interact with us through our Services we may ask for information such as your name, email address, social media IDs, cell phone number, company name, billing address, credit or payment card information. We use this information for general purposes that include: identification and authentication, providing and improving our products and services, contacting you, billing and research.</p>
            <p>Our Services may contain interactive functionality that allows you to engage with other users of the Services, post comments to forums, to upload photographs and other content (the “User Materials”), participate in surveys, and otherwise to interact with the Services and with other users. If you use any interactive functionality on our Services that request or permit you to provide us with personal information (including, for example, any services that allow you to post User Materials on any of our Services), we collect the personal information that you provide to us in the course of using these interactive features.</p>
            <p>If you contact us by e-mail, using a contact form on the Services, or by mail or other means, we collect the personal information contained within, and associated with, your correspondence.</p>
            <p>When you use our Services, some information is collected automatically. For example, we may automatically collect your browser’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, the nature of the device from which you using the Services, the identifier for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, the actions you take while using the Services, and the content, features, and activities that you access and participate in while using the Services. We also may collect information regarding your interaction with e-mail messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service, and we do not share it with or sell it to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
                <li>We transfer information about you in the case where Tetrapod or Chatbox is acquired by or merged with another company or legal entity. In this case, Tetrapod will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Security</h3>
            <p>We take appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your information is located on secure servers and encrypted before it hits our disks. We use https to protect information in transit when you use the Chatbox web application. This applies to your personal information and chat messages.</p>
            <p>Please note that Chatbox may send an email digest containing chat messages to some room participants, depending on a user’s settings. These digests are not encrypted and are only as secure as any other email.</p>
            <p>Links sent to you in “Invitation emails”, “Digest emails” and “Mention emails” are effectively your gateway into Chatbox. If you forward, share, or otherwise divulge those links to a third party, your Chatbox account may be compromised and you may be impersonated.</p>
            <h3>3. Storage, Disclosure and Use of Your Communications</h3>
            <p>By using Chatbox for chatting to just one person, you consent to the storage of your chat history on Chatbox application as the default option. By using Chatbox to chat in rooms with other users, your chat history is saved as the default option. For more information about IM history features and settings, please see Chatbox's support documentation.</p>
            <h3>4. Cookies</h3>
            <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive by our servers so our servers can identify your computer. We use cookies to record session information. We will not share any personally identifiable information stored in the Chatbox cookies with outside companies for any purpose without your permission.</p>
            <h3>5. Data Storage</h3>
            <p>When you use the file transfer feature of Chatbox, the file that you transfer is copied and retained on the servers of our third party service provider after the transfer. Tetrapod does not access or uses these files for any purpose, but please note that these files are not encrypted and could be disclosed in legal proceedings or investigations.</p>
            <h3>6. Children</h3>
            <p>Children’s safety is important to us, and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active interest in the online activities of their children. Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without obtaining parental consent. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 on our Services, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we may have collected any such personal information on our Services, please notify us at <a href="mailto:legal@chatbox.com">legal@chatbox.com.</a>.</p>
            <h3>7. International Visitors</h3>
            <p>Our servers and data centers are located in the United States. If you choose to use the Services from outside the United States, then you should know that you are transferring your personal information outside of your region and into the United States for storage and processing. By providing your personal information to us through your use of the Service, you agree to that transfer, storage, and processing in the United States. Also, we may transfer your data from the United States to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Services. You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data security laws, some of which may be less stringent as compared to those of your own region.</p>
            <h3>8. Disclosure</h3>
            <p>We may disclose your information to third-party service providers (e.g., payment processing and data storage and processing facilities) that assist us in our work. We limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information.</p>
            <p>Tetrapod may disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas, when your actions violate the Terms of Service, or when it is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of our Services and other users of the Services. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise permitted or required by law.</p>
            <h3>9. California Privacy Rights</h3>
            <p>Pursuant to California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties’ or corporate affiliates’ direct marketing purposes.
