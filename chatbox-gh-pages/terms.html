            Thank you for using the Chatbox.com web site (“Chatbox” or the “Site”) and any of the applications, software or services made available through the Site or by Tetrapod Software Inc. ("Tetrapod" or “we” or “us”) (the Site, together with such applications, software or services, collectively, the “Service” and excluding any services provided to you by Tetrapod under a separate written agreement).</p>
            <p id="text">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE, AND HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO AGREE, TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE CHATBOX PRIVACY POLICY (COLLECTIVELY, THE “TERMS OF SERVICE”). If you are not eligible, or do not agree to the Terms of Service, then please do not use the Service.</p>
            <p id="text">If you are entering into these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or business, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its authorized employees and agents, and its affiliates to the Terms of Service. In that case, the terms “you” or “your” shall also refer to such entity, its authorized employees and agents, and its affiliates, as applicable. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the Terms of Service, you may not use the Service. You acknowledge that the Terms of Service is a contract between you and Tetrapod, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and Tetrapod, and it governs your use of the Service.</p>
            <p id="text">The Terms of Service provide that all disputes between you and Tetrapod will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury and your claims cannot be brought as a class action. Please review the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provisions in Section 12 below for the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes with Tetrapod.</p>
            <p id="text">Tetrapod reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service without notice. If we make a material change to the Terms of Service, we will provide you with reasonable notice prior to the change either by emailing the email address associated with your account or by posting a notice on the Site. New features that change the current Service shall be subject to the Terms of Service. If you continue to use the Service after any such updates or changes you shall be deemed have consented to such updates or changes. If any update or change to the Terms of Service is not acceptable to you, your only remedy is to stop accessing and using the Service. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time: <a href="www.tetrapod.io/legal/terms.html">www.tetrapod.io/legal/terms.html</a>
