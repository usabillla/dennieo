            </ul>
            <h3>8. Copyright and Content Ownership</h3>
            <p>All Your Content must comply with all applicable law, including all intellectual property laws.</p>
            <p>We claim no intellectual property rights over Your Content. Your Content remains yours. However, if you or anyone else makes any of Your Content public, you agree to allow others to view and share Your Content. In order for us to provide the Service to you, we require that you grant us certain rights with respect to Your Content. For example, we need to be able to transmit, store and copy Your Content in order to display it to you and other users you are participating in a Chatbox with, to index it so you are able to search it, to make backups to prevent data loss, and so on. Your acceptance of this Terms of Service gives us the permission to do so and you hereby grant to Tetrapod a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicenseable, royalty-free right and license to fully exercise and exploit Your Content (in whole or in part) in connection with our provision of the Service. This permission includes allowing us to use third-party service providers (such as Amazon Web Services) in the operation and administration of the Service and the rights granted to us are extended to these third parties to the degree necessary in order for the Service to be provided.</p>
            <p>Tetrapod does not screen Content, but we have the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any Content, or to terminate or suspend any account that we determine in our sole discretion contains Content that is illegal, obscene, objectionable or violates any party's intellectual property or the Terms of Service. Tetrapod also reserves the right to access your account in order to respond to your requests for technical support.</p>
            <p>From time to time you may give Tetrapod suggestions or feedback about the Service. If you do so, you hereby grant to Tetrapod a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicenseable, assignable, royalty-free, perpetual, paid-up, irrevocable right (including moral rights) and license to fully exercise and exploit such suggestions or feedback (and all related rights) for any purpose.</p>
            <p>The Service and all Content available on the Service is protected by United States and foreign intellectual property laws. Other than Your Content, you have no rights in or to any such Content, and you will not use, copy or display such Content except as permitted under this Agreement in connection with the Service. The Service (including the look and feel thereof) is protected by intellectual property laws, and except for the limited right to access and use the Service as permitted through your account, no license or other right under any intellectual property rights of Tetrapod or any of its affiliates is granted to you in connection with the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, you may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS or visual design elements of the Service without expressed written permission from Tetrapod.</p>
            <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that any Content made available in connection with the Service infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Tetrapod a notice requesting that the Content be removed, or access to it blocked. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see <a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright">http://www.loc.gov/copyright</a> for details). Notices and counter notices with respect to the Service should be sent to Tetrapod at:</p>

            <h3>9. Security</h3>
            <p>You understand that the operation of the Service, including Your Content, may be unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks; (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices and (c) transmission to Chatbox’s third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to operate and maintain the Service. We try to keep the Service bug-free and secure; however, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in doing so, so your use of the Service is at your own risk. Accordingly, you acknowledge that you bear sole responsibility for adequate security, protection and backup of Your Content. Tetrapod will have no liability to you for any unauthorized access to or use of any of Your Content, or any corruption, deletion, destruction or loss of any of Your Content.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge, consent and agree that Tetrapod may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Your Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce the Terms of Service; (iii) respond to claims that any of Your Content violates the rights of third parties; or (iv) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Tetrapod, its users and the public.</p>
            <h3>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
            <p>THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE SITE AND CONTENT, AND ALL SERVER AND NETWORK COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND TETRAPOD (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS AFFILIATES) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TETRAPOD DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR VIRUS-FREE AND NO INFORMATION OR SERVICES OBTAINED BY YOU FROM TETRAPOD OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TERMS OF SERVICE.</p>
            <h3>11. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL TETRAPOD (OR ITS AFFILIATES) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION. IN ADDITION, TETRAPOD AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES, COSTS, LOSSES OR LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF ONE HUNDRED ($100) U.S. DOLLARS. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS TERMS OF SERVICE BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THE TERMS OF SERVICE.</p>
            <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to you. IN THESE STATES, THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
            <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
            <p>You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Tetrapod and its affiliates from and against any claims, actions or demands, including without limitation reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from your breach of this Agreement, any of Your Content that is uploaded, posted or otherwise transmitted to or through the Service, or your other access, contribution to, use or misuse of the Service. Tetrapod shall provide notice to you of any such claim, suit or demand. Tetrapod reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this section. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Tetrapod's defense of such matter.</p>
            <h3>13. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h3>

We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Tetrapod may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Tetrapod shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Tetrapod shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Tetrapod in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.</p>
                <h3>13.5 Fees.</h3>
                <p>In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with the Terms of Service, Tetrapod will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in King County, Washington, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Tetrapod for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
                <h3>13.6 No Class Actions.</h3>
                <p>YOU AND TETRAPOD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Tetrapod agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
                <h3>13.7 Modifications.</h3>
                <p>In the event that Tetrapod makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Tetrapod's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Tetrapod's address for Notice, in which case your account with Tetrapod shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.</p>
                <h3>13.8 Enforceability.</h3>
                <p>If Subsection 12.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 12 of the Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 12 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 14 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Terms of Service.</p>
